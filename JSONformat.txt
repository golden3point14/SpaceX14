  The output JSON has the following elements:

      Tasks                    An array of all tasks seen in the trace
      Events                   An array of all events seen in the trace
      cycleEvents              An array of cycle events generated from user markers
      numCPUs                  Integer, how many CPUs were in the trace
      AutocompleteNames        An array of strings, listing all tasks names
      AutocompleteEventTypes   An array of strings, listing all event types in the trace

  As noted, several of these JSON objects contain other JSON objects: tasks,
  events, and cycleEvents. A task has the following data.

      Task     

      Field             Type           Additional description

      name              string         
      pid               int           
      preemptedBy       string array   Names of tasks that preempted this task
      preemptionCount   int            A running total of times this task was preempted
      totalRuntime      long           Time this task ran in milliseconds during the trace

  An event contains the data in the table below. Switch events contain some
  additional information. The switch event itself belongs to the task that is
  being switched out, but from the extra information field which task was being
  switched in is also noted.

      Event

      Field       Type     Additional description                

      name        string                                          
      pid         int                                             
      cpu         int                                             
      startTime   double   Time in milliseconds since kernel boot 
      eventType   string                                          
      extraInfo   string                                          

      Switch event specific data

      activeName   string   The name of the task switching in
      activePID    string

  If the extra information field of a print event starts with ``CYCLE\_START'',
  then a cycleEvent that contains the following data is created.

      cycleEvent

      Field       Type     Additional description

      startTime   double
      extraInfo   string
